              <p>Right now I am thinking about Enlisting into the Military specificaly into the Navy depending on the score I get when I take the Asvab. I plan to first go into the Military to be able to get the money to go to college after, my future career is to work with fashion designers and be able to work with my own projects on creating my own collection.In the Navy I would like to be able to work with others to help other people </p>

              <p>Coding could be handy by making my own website and show to people, and being able to make money out of it by making websites or webpages for others, either for fun or for a company</p>
